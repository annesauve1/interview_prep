    "Longest Absolute File Path\n",
    "Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.\n",
    "\n",
    "In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):\n",
    "\n",
    "dir\n",
    "⟶ subdir1\n",
    "⟶ ⟶ file1.ext\n",
    "⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1\n",
    "⟶ subdir2\n",
    "⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2\n",
    "⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext\n",
    "If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\". Note that the '\\n' and '\\t' are the new-line and tab characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.\n",

    " Input: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tfile.ext\"\n",
    "Output: 20\n",
    "Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is \"dir/subdir2/file.ext\" of length 20.\n",

    "\"dir/subdir1/file1.ext\" of length 21\n",
    "\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\" of length 32.\n",
    "We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.\n",
